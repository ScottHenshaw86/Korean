# Raw Korean
An full-featured site for learning the Korean language (still under development). The portions of the site that I contributed to include: 
* An entertainment section with K-Pop, movie, and music related articlesthat users can comment on. 
* A grammar sentence game that requires users to drag words and phrases and drop them in the correct order. 
* A photo upload component for users to upload profile pictures.

## Demo
Live site coming soon! Check out this demo in the meantime.
